## Project Overview
The Tamagotchi Emulation Project is a hands-on educational journey where I've learned invaluable skills in embedded systems development and debugging. This project allowed me to emulate the behavior of the LPC1768 microcontroller and the LANDTIGER Board, creating a virtual pet simulation reminiscent of the iconic Tamagotchi toys.

## Specifications
This project consists of two parts, each with specific objectives and features:

### Part 1: Emulation and Basic Functionality
- **Objective:** Establish the fundamental components of a virtual pet simulation.

**Specifications for Part 1:**
1. **Display and Animation:** Create a unique virtual pet character using the display library and implement a basic animation with a 1-second refresh rate.
2. **Virtual Pet Logic:** Display pet status, including age, happiness level, and satiety level. Implement a food menu with options for feeding the pet.
3. **Runaway Sequence and Reset:** Handle pet departure due to low happiness or satiety levels, and provide a reset option for users to start anew.

### Part 2: Advanced Features
- **Objective:** Enhance user interaction and engagement with advanced features.

**Specifications for Part 2:**
1. **Cuddles Animation:** Implement a 2-second cuddles animation upon touching the pet, increasing its happiness level.
2. **Sounds:** Add sound effects for various user actions, including selecting meal/snack options, meal consumption, death/runaway animations, and the Cuddles animation.
3. **Volume Control:** Implement volume adjustment functionality, allowing users to control sound levels using a potentiometer.

## What I've Learned
Throughout this project, I've gained the following key insights and skills:

- **Embedded Systems Development:** I've delved into the world of embedded systems, learning how to program a microcontroller to create a virtual environment.

- **Hardware Emulation:** I've become proficient in using the KEIL software debug environment to emulate hardware behavior, bridging the gap between software and hardware.

- **Creative Problem-Solving:** Crafting a virtual pet with limited resources challenged my creativity and problem-solving skills. I had to optimize code for performance and code size.

- **User Interaction:** I've implemented various interactive features, such as touch-based cuddles animations and sound effects, enhancing the user experience.

- **Software Debugging:** Extensive debugging sessions taught me how to identify and resolve issues efficiently, a crucial skill in software development.

- **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive documentation helped me communicate project details effectively and share my knowledge.
